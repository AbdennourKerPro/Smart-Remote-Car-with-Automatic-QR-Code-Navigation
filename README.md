# Remote controlled and automated car

### The material presented in this repository is part of a school project I carried out in College. We created, using a Raspberry Pi and Python, a remote-controlled car with an automatic mode.

### I uploaded the Python code controlling the motors through the Raspberry Pi, the HTML/Javascript code for the web page controlling the robot and the web server managing communication between the interface and the Raspberry Pi.
